Just some notes for contributors:

* read the whole lot of what's there before creating issues for what should be covered. I've had a few issues raised for stuff that's already covered, which clearly demonstrates people are not doing the minimal due diligence before putting their oar in.
* Try to "get" the narrative voice and match it when writing content. Obviously it'll not be possible for one person to write exactly like another person. My approach is "conversational" rather than "formal". Basically I write stuff exactly how I think it, rather than "versing my words".
* Don't use tags in any code examples.
* Use methods rather than functions in code examples. EG: `myString.len()`, not `len(myString)`.
* all code examples should follow "clean code" practices. IE: should be brief and self-describing. If you need to add a comment, it's probably not "clean".
* Code examples should stay focused: don't include any code not directly necessary to demonstrating the point. Examples will never require CSS, and other than in "tags"/"custom tags" chapter, never need markup.
* Code must run on *ColdFusion 11*. Restrict Lucee examples to where it's absolutely necessary.
* As indicated, don't write content for the empty chapters without first having a chat with me.
* TBC
